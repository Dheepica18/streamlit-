Generative artificial intelligence (AI) describes algorithms (such as ChatGPT) that can be used
 to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos. Recent new
 breakthroughs in the field have the potential to drastically change the way we approach content
 creation. Ready to take your creativity to the next level? Look no further than generative AI! This
 nifty form of machine learning allows computers to generate all sorts of new and exciting
 content, from music and art to entire virtual worlds. And it’s not just for fun—generative AI has
 plenty of practical uses too, like creating new product designs and optimizing business
 processes. So why wait? Unleash the power of generative AI and see what amazing creations
 you can come up with!
 Artificial intelligence is pretty much just what it sounds like—the practice of getting machines to
 mimic human intelligence to perform tasks. You’ve probably interacted with AI even if you don’t
 realize it—voice assistants like Siri and Alexa are founded on AI technology, as are customer
 service chatbots that pop up to help you navigate websites.
 Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence. Through machine learning, practitioners
 develop artificial intelligence through models that can “learn” from data patterns without human
 direction. The unmanageably huge volume and complexity of data (unmanageable by humans,
 anyway) that is now being generated has increased the potential of machine learning, as well as
 the need for it.
 Machine learning is founded on a number of building blocks, starting with classical statistical
 techniques developed between the 18th and 20th centuries for small data sets. In the 1930s
 and 1940s, the pioneers of computing—including theoretical mathematician Alan Turing—began
 working on the basic techniques for machine learning. But these techniques were limited to
 laboratories until the late 1970s, when scientists first developed computers powerful enough to
 mount them.
 Until recently, machine learning was largely limited to predictive models, used to observe and
 classify patterns in content. For example, a classic machine learning problem is to start with an
 image or several images of, say, adorable cats. The program would then identify patterns
 among the images, and then scrutinize random images for ones that would match the adorable
 cat pattern. Generative AI was a breakthrough. Rather than simply perceive and classify a photo
 of a cat, machine learning is now able to create an image or text description of a cat on
 demand
